# stock-kNN
learning abt stocks and kNN
I think that the final project can be an app with a front end and backend where the user can input or use a preset database of stocks to run k-NN analysis on to find stocks similar to them similar to spotify music taste. Basically a similar songs algorithm but instead with stocks. 
To do:
1. Script
2. Database
3. Backend
4. Frontend
5. Other stuff
